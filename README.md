# Phase 1 Project: Virtual Art Museum SPA
## Introduction
Virtual Art Museum (VAM) is a single page application (SPA) created to fufill the requirements of Flatiron's Phase 1 project for the Software Engineering Flex program. VAM integrates data from the The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API [https://metmuseum.github.io/#search] which provides information on more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection. This project requires the use of three unique event listeners to enable user interacitivy.  The frontend is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Description - WIP
The idea for VAM came from an issue I was experiencing at home as a remote employee and student. I found myself being at my desk all day and needed to find a way to reset mentally and differentiate my work time from coding time. I thought of a "digital pallete cleanser",  using a webpage app to take a moment and look at art and spend some time taking a break before entering focused work time. VAM allows users to search MET's Collection using subject keywords and display the search results in a user-friendly format.
